# IoT_Anomaly_Detection
 
IoT Anomaly Detection uses the IoT-23 dataset[1]. The data set is downloaded and its path is written to the necessary places in the data_preprocessing.py script. Then the code is run. The resulting .csv file is given to classifiers.

[1] https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23 (The small one was used in the project.)

Colab Notebook was used because the training of the model requires a lot of memory and takes a long time. (You need to edit the paths in each script for the project to work.)

Accuracies are given below.
